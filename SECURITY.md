# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version on crates.io is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability (e.g. crashes, excessive memory usage, or hangs triggered by crafted PLY inputs), please report it privately.

- Preferred: open a GitHub Security Advisory ("Report a vulnerability")
- Alternatively: open a GitHub issue with minimal details and request a private follow-up

Please include:

- A minimal reproducer (ideally a small PLY file or byte sequence)
- The exact crate version and Rust toolchain
- Whether the issue is in ASCII or binary parsing/writing

We will acknowledge reports as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and release.
